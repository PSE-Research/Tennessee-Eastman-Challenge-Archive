# Tennessee Eastman Challenge

This a fork of [camaramm's tennessee-eastman-challenge][camaramm-tec].

> I don't like binary files, such as: `.dll`, `.zip`, `.pdf`, `.mex` and `.mexw64`.
> And I don't intend to keep those TE codes untouched. 
> I would like to change the format and update the code to make those codes easy to read. 
> So, I choose to open a new repo for this work, and keep using the same license.
